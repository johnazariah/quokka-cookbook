# The Quokka Cookbook

**Quantum computing recipes you can actually run.**

---

## What is this?

A growing collection of self-contained quantum computing recipes — each one explains a concept from the ground up, builds a circuit step by step, and gives you a working [OpenQASM 2.0](https://openqasm.com/) program you can run on your [Quokka](https://www.quokkacomputing.com/).

No framework bloat. No 47 imports. No prerequisites beyond curiosity. Just circuits, explained — then executed.

## Why we're building this

Most quantum computing resources teach you qubits and gates, then leave you stranded somewhere around phase kickback wondering *why you should care*.

We do it the other way around. Each recipe starts with a **problem** — something concrete and interesting — then builds the quantum circuit that solves it. Theory arrives when it's useful, not when it's scheduled. Phase kickback shows up when it saves you a measurement, not because it's Chapter 3.

The goal is **understanding through doing**. If you can read a `for` loop, you can read a quantum circuit. And if you can run one, you'll understand it better than if you'd read ten pages of formalism.

## What's Quokka?

    ---

    [Quokka](https://www.quokkacomputing.com/) is a 30-qubit quantum computing system built by [Eigensystems](https://www.quokkacomputing.com/) in Australia. It's a physical device — a puck that fits in your hand — with a companion [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/quokka-quantum/id6754873585) and cloud platform.

    ---

    Quokka runs standard [OpenQASM 2.0](https://openqasm.com/) — no proprietary language, no SDK lock-in. Every recipe in this cookbook is a plain text `.qasm` file. What you learn here works everywhere.

## What's coming

We're releasing recipes regularly, building from the fundamentals to real applications. Each recipe is a self-contained blog post with a runnable circuit.

| | Course | What you'll learn |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| **Appetizers** | Bell state, teleportation, Deutsch-Jozsa | Entanglement, measurement, your first quantum speedup |
| **Mains** | Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon, Grover, QAOA, VQE, QFT | Oracles, search, optimisation, molecular simulation |
| **Desserts** | Phase estimation, error mitigation, quantum counting | The techniques that power the big algorithms |

!!! tip "How each recipe works"

    Every recipe follows the same structure:

    1. **What are we making?** — the problem, in plain language
    2. **Ingredients** — what you need to know (with links if you need a refresher)
    3. **Method** — the circuit, built incrementally with explanation at every step
    4. **Taste test** — run it on your Quokka, see the output, interpret the results
    5. **Chef's notes** — gotchas, deeper connections, and what to try next

## Who is this for?

- **Students** taking a quantum computing course who want a hands-on companion
- **Software engineers** curious about quantum computing but allergic to hype
- **Researchers** who want a quick reference for standard circuits and protocols
- **Anyone** who learns by doing rather than by reading axioms

No physics degree required. We introduce every concept when it's needed, in the context of a working circuit.

Every `.qasm` file in this cookbook is a valid OpenQASM 2.0 program. If you want to go beyond Quokka, the same files run on IBM Quantum, Qiskit, or any other QASM-compatible platform. **Your learning is portable.**
