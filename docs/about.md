## What is The Quokka Cookbook?

A collection of quantum computing recipes — self-contained, problem-first, and executable on [Quokka](https://www.quokkacomputing.com/). Born from the belief that the best way to learn quantum computing is to *run quantum circuits*, not to stare at axioms.

## Who made this?

[John Azariah](https://github.com/johnazariah) — quantum computing researcher, author of *Qubit-Efficient Encodings for Binary Optimisation Problems*, and someone who got tired of watching smart people bounce off quantum computing because the teaching order is wrong.

## The teaching philosophy

Most resources teach quantum computing **bottom-up**: start with linear algebra, define qubits, prove properties of gates, build up to algorithms. By the time you reach anything interesting, you've forgotten why you started.

We teach **problem-down**: start with something you want to compute, figure out what circuit solves it, and learn the theory because you need it — not because it's on a syllabus.

Every concept in this cookbook is introduced **at the point where it's useful**, in the context of a working circuit. Phase kickback isn't Chapter 3; it shows up when it saves you a measurement. The QFT isn't a standalone topic; it appears when it solves a problem.

## Why Quokka?

[Quokka](https://www.quokkacomputing.com/) runs standard OpenQASM 2.0. That means:

- **No SDK lock-in.** The circuits are the code. No `import qiskit` boilerplate.
- **Tactile learning.** A physical device makes the abstract concrete.
- **Portable knowledge.** Every `.qasm` file works on any QASM-compatible platform.

Quokka is built by [Eigensystems](https://www.quokkacomputing.com/) in Australia.
